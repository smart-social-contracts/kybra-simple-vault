# kybra-simple-vault

This project allows to:


for non-icp users
    use ck minter to give them a native address (BTC, ETH or USDC)
    take the minted ck to the realm treasury

for icp users
    give them a unique ckBTC/ckETH/ckUSDC address for all of them
    scan for deposits into that address and internally allocate their ck to the realm treasury
    Future improvement: use subaccounts
